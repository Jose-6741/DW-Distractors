            <div class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6" id="text">Dandy’s World is a team rogue-like mascot horror in which you must travel between floors with up to 7 other people completing ichor-extraction machines while simultaneously avoiding twisteds. Twisteds are characters or “Toons” overcome with ichor, turning them corrupt and almost zombie-like. The amount of machines and twisteds increase after every few floors. There are 6 different stat categories that vary between the 38 different playable Toons. 8 of these Toons are “main Toons”, these toons are different from the other 30 due to having one extra star in their stat pool along with a second ability. These benefits come at the cost of one of their 3 hearts. Depending on what role you wish to play, you might lean towards characters with certain stats.</div>

            <div class="col-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12" id="text">Distractors are one of the crucial roles needed in order to reach high floors without much trouble, they rely on high movement speed and low stealth to keep the attention of twisteds while also keeping their distance from them. They have to be able to adapt to special twisteds' abilities and varying run speeds while also makeing sure the twisteds don't favor a teammates line-of-sight.</div>

Although his stealth is on par with many toons which would usually prove to be a disability, he remains a viable choice for distractors because of his active ability, “Speak!”. This allows him to bark drastically lowering his stealth momentarily while gaining the attention of any nearby twisteds, causing them to run to his location if not already occupied.</div>
